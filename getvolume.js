class Kata {
  static getVolumeOfCuboid(length, width, height) {

}
//after googling the equation for finding volume in an object...
//and realizing I am unfamiliar with the syntax above for a function...
//I went with my gut instict and did a return with the equation...
//bam it worked. score.

//however, this is the code I wanted to write that wasn't accepted but works:

function getVolumeOfCubiod(length, width, height) {
  return length * width * height
}
getVolumeOfCubiod(//put your three numbers - arguments here//)
